## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS utility classes
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I am happy that I got this project working correctly, but I need to work on refactoring my code to keep it DRY and readable.

### Useful resources

- [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/radio/radio-1/radio-1.html) - A great resource for best practices for accessibility.
- [UK Home Office design system](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/) - A huge help in overall accessibility practices, and for this project, their approach to ensuring keyboard accessible form controls was extremely valuable.
